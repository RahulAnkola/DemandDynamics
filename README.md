Traditional grocery store inventory management lacks accuracy and adaptability, leading to waste and lost sales. The absence of a Deep Learning solution analysing historical sales data hampers optimal stock levels, profitability, and customer satisfaction. To overcome this problem, we are building a model thatÂ gives retailers:
- the capacity to save costs
- boost profits
- provides customers a smooth shopping experience by precisely forecasting demand


This model is a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). It uses a 1D Convolutional layer and a Max Pooling layer, which are characteristic of CNNs, to extract features from the input sequence. After these layers, the Flatten layer transforms the 2D output of the previous layers into a 1D array, which can then be fed into the Dense layers. The Dense layers form a Multi-Layer Perceptron that can learn from the extracted features to make the final prediction.
